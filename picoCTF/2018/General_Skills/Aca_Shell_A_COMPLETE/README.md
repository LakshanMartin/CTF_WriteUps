This problem is solved wholly within the picoCTF shell. 

This problem is solved in a hacking simulator manner in which the user is 
prompted to follow instructions and execute commands.

The commands are no different to those that have been used in prior challenges,
except for the 'whoami' command to retrieve the username.

After successfully following the instructions the flag is presented.
