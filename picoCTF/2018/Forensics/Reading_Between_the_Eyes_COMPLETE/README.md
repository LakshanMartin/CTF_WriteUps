# Reading Between the Eyes
------------------------

This problem introduced Steganography. We were given a .png file that obviously
had the flag embedded within it.

I used zsteg to extract the embedded data. Then grep the flag contents and
output to flag.txt.

Flag:
    picoCTF{r34d1ng_b37w33n_7h3_by73s}
