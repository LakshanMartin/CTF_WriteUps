The flag for this challenge has been split into two separate parts.
Both parts can be found by inspecting the page source of the given website.

Flag 1/2: 
- Can be found by using curl "http://2018shell.picoctf.com:53213/"
- The flag notation is easy to find. 

Flag 2/2:
- Can be found by using curl "http://2018shell.picoctf.com:53213/mycss.css"
- The rest of the flag is at the bottom.

I just copy and pasted the two flag portions for submission:

	picoCTF{ur_4_real_1nspect0r_g4dget_402b0bd3}


Flag recorded in flag.txt as usual.
