Client Side is Still Bad
------------------------

This problem involves inspecting the page source of the given website.
The flag is broken up in reverse order through several nested if-statements.

To solve, i did the following:
1. curl the website and remove everything except the flag portions.
2. tac <-- to have the flag portions output in correct order.
3. tr -d "\n" <-- to remove newline of each flag portion
4. > flag.txt <-- output complete flag to text file.

Final command used:
    curl -s http://2018shell.picoctf.com:53990/ | head -n 20 | 
    cut -d "'" -f2 | tail -n 8 | tac | tr -d "\n" > flag.txt

Flag:
    picoCTF{client_is_bad_040594}
